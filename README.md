# STEPS:
Bring movies from the API.
Show the movies.
Show the description of a movie.
Use PlayerJS to play movies.
Use another API for subtitles(I think i'll need parse from XML to JSON).
# # First
28/04/2018 Paginate movie's list.
# # 20180516
13/05/2018 Movie's list done. Torrents working perfectly.

Need REST API for subtitles.
Need some CSS for PlayerJS

# # 20180522
Added 720p movies. Need some style make buttons.
I need parse subtitles from SRT to VTT. Still working.
* Idea:
I can use a microservice to download subtitles and then parsing or i can
put an upload button and parse the subtitle with a method and a Open Dialog.
